## ðŸŽ¬ Demo Script

### Introduction (1 minute)

"Welcome to the WhatsX messaging automation prototype demonstration. Today I'll show you how this prototype implements template management, user management, and intelligent duplicate detection for bulk messaging campaigns."

"Let me start by showing you the landing page and then we'll dive into the core functionality."

---

### Scene 1: Landing Page and Login (1 minute)

**Action**: Navigate to http://localhost:3000

**Narration**: 
"As you can see, we have a clean, professional landing page that introduces WhatsX as a messaging automation platform. The page highlights the key features: Template Management, User Management, and Duplicate-safe Sending."

**Action**: Click "Sign Up / Login"

**Narration**:
"Let me log in as an administrator to show you the full functionality. I'll use the admin credentials: admin@whatsx.com / admin123"

**Action**: Enter credentials and login

**Narration**:
"Perfect! I'm now logged in and redirected to the dashboard. You can see my role is displayed as 'ADMIN' in the sidebar."

---

### Scene 2: Admin Dashboard and User Management (3 minutes)

**Action**: Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Users

**Narration**:
"First, let me show you the user management capabilities. As an admin, I can create, update, and delete users. This is essential for managing access to the platform."

**Action**: Click "Add User"

**Narration**:
"Let me create a new end user. I'll fill in the required information: name, email, password, and set the role to 'END_USER'. I can also set a default country code for phone number normalization."

**Action**: Fill in form and create user

**Narration**:
"Great! The new user has been created and appears in the table. I can also edit users to change their roles or status, and delete users when needed."

**Action**: Show edit and delete functionality

**Narration**:
"This demonstrates complete CRUD operations for user management, which is one of our key acceptance criteria."

---

### Scene 3: Template Management (3 minutes)

**Action**: Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Templates

**Narration**:
"Next, let me show you template management. Templates are message templates that admins create and all users can use for consistent communication."

**Action**: Click "Create Template"

**Narration**:
"I'll create a welcome message template. Notice that I can use variables like {{name}} for personalization. The template content supports up to 5000 characters and I can activate or deactivate templates as needed."

**Action**: Create a template with title "Welcome Message" and content "Hello {{name}}, welcome to WhatsX!"

**Narration**:
"Excellent! The template is now created and active. Let me show you how this looks from an end user's perspective."

---

### Scene 4: End User Experience - Templates and Contacts (3 minutes)

**Action**: Logout and login as user@whatsx.com / user123

**Narration**:
"Now I'm logged in as an end user. Notice that I can see the templates created by the admin, but I cannot edit or delete them - they're read-only for end users."

**Action**: Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Contacts

**Narration**:
"Let me show you contact management. I can add contacts manually with names, phone numbers, and labels. The system automatically normalizes phone numbers to E.164 format."

**Action**: Add a contact with name "John Doe" and phone "+1234567890"

**Narration**:
"Perfect! The contact is added and the phone number is normalized. I can also import contacts in bulk using CSV files."

**Action**: Switch to Import CSV tab

**Narration**:
"Here I can upload a CSV file with contacts. The system supports name, phone, and label columns, and it automatically detects duplicates during import."

---

### Scene 5: Prepare to Send - Core Feature (5 minutes)

**Action**: Navigate to Dashboard â†’ Prepare to Send

**Narration**:
"Now for the most important feature - the Prepare to Send flow with intelligent duplicate detection. This is where the magic happens!"

**Action**: Select the "Welcome Message" template

**Narration**:
"I'll start by selecting a template. The message content is automatically populated, but I can still edit it if needed."

**Action**: Add recipients manually with different formats:
```
+92-300-1234567
03001234567
3001234567
```

**Narration**:
"Notice that I'm entering the same phone number in different formats. This is where our intelligent duplicate detection comes into play."

**Action**: Click "Prepare to Send"

**Narration**:
"Amazing! The system has detected that all three numbers are actually the same when normalized. It shows us:
- 1 final recipient (instead of 3)
- 2 duplicates removed
- A detailed duplicates report showing exactly why each was removed"

**Action**: Show the duplicates report

**Narration**:
"This demonstrates our sophisticated phone normalization algorithm and duplicate detection. The system can handle various formats and prevents sending multiple messages to the same person."

---

### Scene 6: Advanced Duplicate Detection Scenarios (2 minutes)

**Action**: Go back and add more recipients including existing contacts

**Narration**:
"Let me show you another scenario. I'll add some recipients that match existing contacts in my database."

**Action**: Add recipients including some that match existing contacts

**Narration**:
"When I prepare to send again, you'll see that the system detects duplicates against existing contacts and flags them appropriately."

**Action**: Show the different types of duplicates:
- "duplicate_in_upload" - same number appears multiple times in upload
- "duplicate_existing_contact" - number matches existing contact
- "unparseable" - number cannot be normalized

**Narration**:
"This comprehensive duplicate detection ensures that no one receives duplicate messages, which is crucial for professional communication."

---

### Scene 7: Export and Reporting (1 minute)

**Action**: Show export functionality

**Narration**:
"The system also provides comprehensive reporting. I can download the final recipient list and the duplicates report as CSV files for record-keeping and analysis."

**Action**: Download both CSV files

**Narration**:
"This gives users full transparency into what happened during the deduplication process and provides audit trails."

---

### Scene 8: Prototype Limitations (1 minute)

**Action**: Show the disabled "Confirm & Queue" button

**Narration**:
"As this is a prototype, the actual message sending is not implemented. The 'Confirm & Queue' button is intentionally disabled and shows 'Prototype: sending not implemented'."

**Narration**:
"This prototype focuses specifically on demonstrating the duplicate detection and preparation flow, which are the core requirements for this phase of development."

---

### Conclusion (1 minute)

**Narration**:
"In summary, the WhatsX prototype successfully demonstrates:

âœ… **Template Management**: Admins can create and manage templates that all users can access
âœ… **User Management**: Complete CRUD operations with role-based access control  
âœ… **Duplicate Detection**: Intelligent phone normalization and duplicate prevention
âœ… **Contact Management**: Manual and CSV-based contact import with validation
âœ… **Prepare-to-Send Flow**: Comprehensive duplicate reporting and export functionality

**Narration**:
"The prototype meets all acceptance criteria and provides a solid foundation for a full-featured messaging automation platform. The duplicate detection algorithm handles various phone number formats and prevents duplicate messages effectively."

**Narration**:
"Thank you for your time! I'm happy to answer any questions about the implementation or demonstrate any specific scenarios you'd like to see."
