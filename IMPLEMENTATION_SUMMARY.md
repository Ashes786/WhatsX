## 🏗️ Technical Implementation

### Architecture
- **Frontend**: Next.js 15 with TypeScript
- **Backend**: Next.js API routes
- **Database**: SQLite with Prisma ORM
- **Authentication**: NextAuth.js
- **UI Framework**: shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Validation**: Zod schema validation

### Key Components

#### 1. **Database Schema**
```sql
-- Core tables implemented:
- users (with role-based access)
- templates (admin-created, user-visible)
- contacts (user-owned, with phone normalization)
- prepare_to_send_jobs (ephemeral job tracking)
```

#### 2. **Phone Normalization Algorithm**
```typescript
// Implements exact specification:
function normalizePhoneNumber(rawPhone: string, defaultCountryCode?: string): string | null {
  // 1. Strip all non-digit and non-plus characters
  // 2. Replace "00" with "+"
  // 3. Keep "+" prefix
  // 4. Handle local numbers with default country code
  // 5. Return E.164 format or null
}
```

#### 3. **Duplicate Detection Logic**
```typescript
// Detects and categorizes duplicates:
- duplicate_in_upload: Same number appears multiple times
- duplicate_existing_contact: Matches existing contact
- unparseable: Cannot normalize the number
- same_as_another_normalized: Normalizes to same as another
```

#### 4. **API Endpoints**
```
Authentication:
- POST /api/auth/login
- POST /api/auth/logout

User Management (Admin):
- GET /api/admin/users
- POST /api/admin/users
- PUT /api/admin/users/:id
- DELETE /api/admin/users/:id

Templates:
- GET /api/templates
- GET /api/templates/:id
- POST /api/admin/templates
- PUT /api/admin/templates/:id
- DELETE /api/admin/templates/:id

Contacts:
- GET /api/contacts
- POST /api/contacts
- PUT /api/contacts/:id
- DELETE /api/contacts/:id
- POST /api/contacts/upload-csv

Prepare to Send:
- POST /api/prepare-to-send
```
